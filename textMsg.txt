*Greetings from _ENACTUS SRM_ .This is _Meraki_. Live and Stereo, ready to help you with your queries. We're here to enlighten you regarding:*
*A) Discovering  Yourself :* Discovering ourselves  helps us to identify our abilities, and also how we can leverage and develop them. As you can find out what you are passionate about, it's easier to grasp the concepts and accept them.
*B)	Break the monotony:* Following the same schedule, doing the same things everyday will make you trapped in a life of routines and sameness. Unvarying events adversely affects your performance, morale, and quality of work. Breaking the monotony will give you more flexibility, new streams of creativity and make your life more exciting and interesting.
*C)	Meaning in life:* Meaning serves a number of important functions in human lives Firstly, meaning provides a purpose for our lives. Secondly, it furnishes values or standards by which to judge our actions. Thirdly, it gives us a sense of control over the events in our life. Lastly, it provides us with self-worth.
*D)	Befriending Emotions:*  Befriending emotions is a gentle way to be mindful of what we're experiencing without judging ourselves. It allows us to process feelings like anger and hate. Being gently present with how feelings are living in our body can give us some distance from them.
*E)	Anchor Yourself:*  An anchor at sea can be life saving or life threatening. Much like a sea voyage, we need to anchor ourselves to a strong value system, with a prioritization that helps you make decisions based on what is most important. Super clear goals that drive your actions and habits. However, anchors can also be negative, base beliefs that propagate only material joy and determine our self worth can often be detrimental.
